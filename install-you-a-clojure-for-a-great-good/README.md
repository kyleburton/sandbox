# Install You a Clojure For a Great Good

The intent of this project is to ease the process of bootstrapping a development environment for Clojure.  This project was created to help share my own personal development setup, though it will be organized to represent many different setups.  The intent of each setup will be to create self-contained configurations for development environments, with scripted setups.

For each configuration, we'll keep a list of the operating systems, versions and software package versions that are reported to work so you'll be able to detrmine which of the environments should work on your system.

# Configurations

## Live Development

### Live Emacs and CIDER : ./live-emacs-cider/

Who: Kyle and Dane

TODO: Leiningen, Emacs, CIDER, and a 'lein run' that starts a JVM that you connect to in order to evolve your application.
