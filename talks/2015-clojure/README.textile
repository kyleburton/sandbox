Tim Visher contacted me and asked me to share my experience building and
deploying services with Clojure.

Tim and I worked together at Relay Network, and Tim has been contrasting his
experiences before we worked together (in an Enterprise Shop), and after we
worked together (when Tim gained experience working at tech start-ups).
