Tim Visher contacted me and asked me to share my experience building and
deploying services with Clojure.

Tim and I worked together at Relay Network, and Tim has been contrasting his
experiences before we worked together (in an Enterprise Shop), and after we
worked together (when Tim gained experience working at tech start-ups).


Some of the themes we want to roll up into a talk are:

* Holistic Consistency
* Convention over Configuration
* Unorthodox, but consistent, choices reduce effort of development deployment and debugging


h3. Convention over Configuration

    We chose a model for the ports our services listen on, though we support configuration.
    This allows us to run our full stack of services on a single system without having
    to do any explicit configuration.  This same convention is followed in our CI, QA, UAT
    and production environments even though they are multi-system.

h3. Anatomy of @-main@

    


Stream of consciousness:

tv: 'organize and build your services so that devs move fast and deployment is invisible
