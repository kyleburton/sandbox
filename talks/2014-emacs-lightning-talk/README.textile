h1. Overview

At a Clojadelphia meeting, a few people asked me to give a lightning talk on
how I use Emacs.

What I want to get across is that Emacs is extensible and that you can extend
it to improve your productivity.  It is designed very much in the lisp spirit
of "build the language up toward your program", where you can "build the IDE up
toward your application".
