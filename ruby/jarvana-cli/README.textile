h1. Jarvana-cli

"Jarvana":http://jarvana.com/jarvana/ is a wonderful search engine for Java projects that are available in the main "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/ repositories.  Jarvana makes it sigificantly easier to locat and make use of these resources.

Rather than using a browser, I prefer the command line tools and wanted to have a command line UI for finding and making use of the Jarvana search.  This utility is just such a command line UI.
