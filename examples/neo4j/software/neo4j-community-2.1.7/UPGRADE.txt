    Important

    This section describes upgrading a single Neo4j instance. Upgrading a Neo4j
    HA cluster (Neo4j Enterprise) requires a very specific process be followed.
    Please refer to ???.

A database created by an older version of Neo4j will be upgraded when opened by 
Neo4j 2.1.7 during startup. Whilst this upgrade will occur automatically for 
minor changes, larger migrations require explicit configuration before Neo4j 
will start.

Each Neo4j version supports upgrading from a limited number of previous 
versions. These upgrades are either automatic, or require explicit 
configuration to allow them.

In this release of Neo4j, the following upgrades are permitted.

1.9.x --> 2.1.7
    Explicit configuration is required

2.0.x --> 2.1.7
    Explicit configuration is required

2.1.x --> 2.1.7
    Automatically performs any store upgrade



    Note

    Downgrade is only supported between Neo4j versions that allow for automatic
    store upgrades. This typically means only within patch releases of the same
    Neo4j version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Automatic Store Upgrade

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform a normal store upgrade (for minor changes to the database store):

   1. Cleanly shut down the older version of Neo4j, if it is running.
   2. Install Neo4j 2.1.7, and set it up to use the same database store
      directory (typically data/graph.db).
   3. NOTE: It is strongly advised to make a copy of the database store
      directory at this time, to use as a backup in case rollback/downgrade is
      required. This is not necessary if a backup has been made using the 
      online backup tool, available with Neo4j Enterprise.
   4. Start up Neo4j.
   5. Any database store upgrade required will occur during startup.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Explicit Store Upgrade

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform an explicit store upgrade (required for significant changes to the 
database store):

   1. Cleanly shut down the older version of Neo4j, if it is running.
   2. Install Neo4j 2.1.7, and set it up to use the same database store
      directory (typically data/graph.db).
   3. Set the Neo4j configuration parameter allow_store_upgrade=true in your 
      conf/neo4j.properties file. Neo4j will fail to start without this
      configuration set.
   4. Start up Neo4j.
   5. The database store upgrade will occur during startup.
   6. The allow_store_upgrade configuration parameter should be removed, set to 
      false or commented out.
   7. Information about the upgrade and a progress indicator are logged into
      the messages.log file, inside the database store directory.


    Caution

    An explicit upgrade will require substantial free disk space, as it must
    make an entire copy of the database store. The upgraded store version may
    also require larger store files overall. It is suggested to have available
    free disk space equivalent to at least 1.5 times the size of the existing
    store.


    Note

    Cypher compatibility: The Cypher language is rapidly evolving, and may
    change between Neo4j versions (although not between patch releases).
    However, Neo4j supports compatibility directives for Cypher, that allow
    explicitly selecting a language version. This is possible to do for
    individual statements, or globally, as described in the Cypher
    Compatibility section.
