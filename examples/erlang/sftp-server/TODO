Use Erlang's SFTP daemon with AWS S3 as a backing store.

My use-case is:

  * a client drops a file off on our sftp server 
  * we want to auto-process the file, which involves:
    * seeing that it arrived
    * placing it in shared storage so other systmes can access it (s3)

What I'd like this SFTP daemon to do:

* Store/Pull sftp credentials from a bucket/path
*
