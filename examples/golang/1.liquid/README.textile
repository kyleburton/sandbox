Identify files with YAML front-matter

Compute and track dependency graph of files
  when a file changes, recompute only those
  that hae it as a dependency


Minimum Liquid Features I need to support:
* Layouts
* Simple plugins for:
  * js_includes_cdn: [ f1.js, f2.js ]
     NB: this can span multiple lines
  * stylesheet_cdn : {% stylesheet_cdn "/path/css/foo.css" %}
  * rn_build_info (one instance?)
  * javascript_cdn : {% javascript_cdn %}
  * include:         {% include "/paht/to/filename.js" %}
  * include:         {% include filename %}
