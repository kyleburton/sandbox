Notable Differences between Elixir and Erlang

* "Keyword" lists appear to be an Erlang proplists
* Elixir strings support interpolation: "hellö #{:world}"

Notes

* Elixir requires at least Erlang/OTP 20


TODO:

* What does it look like to have a single project that mixes Erlang and Elixir in the same repo, will the build tooling compile erlang as well?
* interoperability Elixir to Erlang & Back
* hit up the github apis?
* webapp for configuration management?
* can we wrap lastpass as well?
