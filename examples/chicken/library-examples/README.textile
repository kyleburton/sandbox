h1. Chicken Scheme Examples

  "Official Chicken Scheme Site":http://call-cc.org/
  "Chicken Libraries (eggs)":http://wiki.call-cc.org/chicken-projects/egg-index-4.html

h2. Examples I want

* Mechanize like http client example code, show use of auth, cookies and ssl
* processing yaml, probably via C library libyaml, see: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML (exists in homebrew and apt)
* interacting with a database, eg: postgres and mysql
* easyweb: spiffy has no routing table to map routes to handlers as with projects like Rails, the more automagical the better.  Also: show cookie support
* concurrency and threading examples: ipc between threads, mutexes, passing information and coordination
* examples of non-blocking IO (select, [ke]poll, etc) - maybe even a web server framework
* sending mail via smtp (there is an smtp egg for chicken v3 but not one for v4 that I was able to find)
* 0mq
* amqp interaction, see http://www.rabbitmq.com/c-client.html
* redis, see http://redis.io/clients and https://github.com/antirez/hiredis, start w/synchronous API
