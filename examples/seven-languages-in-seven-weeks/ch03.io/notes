  "Steve Dekorte invented the Io language in 2002"

p62
  "Io syntax simply chains messages together, with each message returning an
   object and each message taking optional parameters in parentheses. In Io,
   everything is a message that returns another receiver."


  "Io gets you about as close to object-oriented Lisp as youâ€™re likely to get."

    ...hrm...
    Tate leaves this unexplained.  Having traveled my own road, I don't know what
    he means by this and since he doesn't touch 'lisp' in this book (Clojure further on
    is a lisp, though I don't think how it's covered in this book is related to
    this statement).

! doFile("day01.io") // load&run a file

! slotNames
! Protos Core
! Protos Core slotNames
! Protos Core Sequence slotNames
