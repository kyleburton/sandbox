I'm new to LoL as a game.  At this time I don't even recognize the champions themselves.  I want something to
help me learn the encyclopedic landscape of the game, its champions, their abilities, its items and lore.

* Identfy Portraits: Champions by name, multiple choice
* Identfy Portraits: Champions by name free form
* Identfy Portraits: Champions by role, multiple choice
* Identfy Portraits: Champions by role free form
* Identfy Portraits: Items by name, multiple choice


Overall Design:

* react.js via reagent front-end
* back-end services only for generating static content as json into ./resources/
* front-end pulls data on demand from backend as users navigate the front-end
* use localStorage for tracking any state for the first milestones
