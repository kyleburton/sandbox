h1. Cucumber Example

"Cucumber":http://cukes.info/ is a behavior driven development tool which can also be used to perform front-end or integration tetsing on your web applications.  This archive shows a few examples of how it can be used.

h2. Tagging Scenarios

You can tag your scenarios with '@' tags which will allow you to run them as groups using the '--tags' command line parameter for cucubmer:

<pre>
  $ cucumber --tags @dev
</pre>

h3. Profiles

Cucumber supports profiles.  It finds profile configurations in config/cucumber.yml, if the file is present it must at least contain a default profile.

In this example, there are profiles set up to load different configurations based on a .rb file named after the profile.

<pre>
  $ cucumber -p dev
</pre>


One thing to keep in mind with using '--require' and cucumber is that it disables all of the default code loading that cucumber does on its own, so you'll need to laod your own step_definitions, support files, as well as any other support code you may need if you use this approach.
