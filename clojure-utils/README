Run bootstrap-maven.sh to install clojure, clojure-contrib and the
rabbit-mq-java-client into your maven repository.  boostrap will also
install the quartz clojure adapter into your local maven repository.

After this, executing mvn compile in the kyleburton-clojure-utils
should build the jar, and a bin/repl and bin/slime-incl.el which you
can add to your .emacs file as 

  (load "<<path-to-project>>/bin/slime-incl.el")

There is still 1 thing you must do, which is add the location of
swank-clojure to the bin/repl's classpath.  I'm not sure of the best
way to get around this as of yet.  A more permanent solution should be
built into the build when one is found.
